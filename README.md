# Simple-Obstacle-Game
 
 ### BOX RUN 
 (Official name I guess?)

A simple obstacle game where you play as a cardboard box based off a beginner tutorial by: [Brackeys on YouTube][tutorial playlist]
 <br>
 The game contains 3 custom levels amde by me, each with different mechanics for example, ramps/boosts, flying projectiles, etc.
<br>
 Made this game to understand the process of making a game from creating movement to publishing/building.

 
 üïπÔ∏è The game is playable on Itch.io (Playable on browser): [Click here to Play][itch link]
